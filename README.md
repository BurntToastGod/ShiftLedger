# ShiftLedger

## 🎯 Overview

ShiftLedger is a lightweight shift tracking and payment ledger tool built specifically for gig workers. It solves the painful problem of missing payments, scattered shift records, and weak dispute leverage by providing a single automated "source of truth" for all your gig work.

## 🔥 The Problem

Gig workers on platforms like Shiftsmart, Uber, DoorDash, Instacart, and similar apps face:

- **Missing or incorrect pay**: Hours worked don't match payouts, with frequent glitches and delayed payments
- **No clean record of work**: Shifts, clock-in/out times, locations, and notes are scattered across apps, screenshots, and memory
- **Weak leverage in disputes**: When pay is missing or wrong, workers can't easily show a clean, timestamped history to support their case
- **Tax and income chaos**: Multiple apps, different pay methods, and no unified view of actual earnings

## ✨ The Solution

ShiftLedger provides:

- **Fast, dead-simple shift logging**: Quick entry for start/end times, location, platform, pay rate, and outcome
- **Automated earnings summaries**: Track total earnings across all platforms in one place
- **One-click dispute packets**: Export all evidence for a specific shift or pay period instantly
- **Tax-ready exports**: Clean CSV/PDF exports for tax preparation
- **Multi-platform support**: Track work across Shiftsmart, Uber, DoorDash, Instacart, and more

## 🎯 Target User

You're the perfect user if you:

- Work on shift-based gig platforms (Shiftsmart, temp retail, warehouse, app-based day labor)
- Do multiple gigs per week and juggle more than one platform
- Have experienced missing/incorrect payouts in the last 6-12 months
